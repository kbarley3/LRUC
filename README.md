Challenge: Least Recently Used Cache - Design and build a least recently used cache, which evicts the least recently used item. The cache should map from keys to values (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associated with a particular key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full, it should evict the least recently used item.  
Solution Approach: For this I used a LinkedHashMap since it preserves insertion order. This makes it easier to manage what was Least Recently Used. After setting up random keys and values, the program will first check to see if the key is already present. If so, then it will delete that key and insert it again with the new value. This will update the keys value and its recently used order. If the key is not present, it will then check if the cache is full. If so, then it will remove the first key in the LinkedHashMap (this is the least recently used item) and then insert the new key and value. If neither the key is present or the cache is full, then it inserts the new key and value.
